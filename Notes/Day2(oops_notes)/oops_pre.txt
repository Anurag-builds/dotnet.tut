OOPS(Object Oriented Programmings)

1.Encapsulation
2.Inheritance
3.Polymorphism
4.Abstraction

class
it is blueprint for the object.
it is collection of data members and functions members.

eg.
customer
cid,cname,adhar,phno,address,bal
withdraw(),deposit(),view_balance()

book
bid,bname,author,price
issue(),return(),view_details(),edit_book()

object
it is instance of an class.
Accenture obj=new Accenture();

encapsulation
protection by data hiding
it is binding of data and methods together in singe unit,which provide protective wrapper over class.

encapsulation is achieved by using access specifiers and properties

Access Specifiers
1.private-accessible only within the class
2.protected-accessible only within the class and to derived class
3.public-accessible outside the class and outside the namespace
4.internal-accessible outside the class but inside the namespace only

default access specifier of the class member is private

inheritance
why?-code reusability
one class acquires the properties of the other class.
generalized to specialized

employee-->Trainer-->.NET_Trainer

base/super/parent
derived/sub/child

types of inheritance
1.simple
A-->B
emp-->trainer

2.multilevel
A-->B-->C
emp-->trainer-->dotnet_trainer

3.multiple
A,B-->C
multiple inheritance is not supported in csharp
only one class you can inherit

4.Hireechical
A-->B,C,D
vechicle-->car,truck,bus,auto

Abstraction
hiding unessential and showing essential
hiding internal details
eg.whatsapp msg

polymorpshism
poly-many
morphism-forms
one method can take many forms
eg.amazon payment

types of polymorphism
1.compile time polymorphism/static/early binding
eg.method overloading

2.runtime polymorphism/dynamic/late binding
eg.method overriding
