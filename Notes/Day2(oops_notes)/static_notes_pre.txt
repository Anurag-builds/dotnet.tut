static 
1.static method-called without object
2.static variable-create single copy of memory which is shared by all objects the class
3.static constructor-called only once either we create first object or called static method
4.static class-contains only static members, cannot add instance members
5.static property -called without object

when we create object--memory created(occupied)-memory efficiency reduced

static method
static method is called without object
static method can access only static members.

class Employee
{
	int empno;
	string empname;
	static string companyname;
}

60 memories empno
60 memories empname
1 memory companyname="accenture"

static variable
it is create only one copy of memory which is shared by all objects of the class, so memory efficiency will increase.

static constructor
it is called only once either we create first object or call static method.
use of static constructor:
1.code which you want to execute only once then you can write that code in static constructor.
2.static variable should be initlized into static constructor

static variable--create only one memory which is shared by all objects
class Employee
{
	int empno;
	string empname;
	static string companyname; //1 memory

	static Employee()
	{
		companyname="accenture";
	}
}
60 objects-static constructor called only 1 time
