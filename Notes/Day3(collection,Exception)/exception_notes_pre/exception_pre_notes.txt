runtime -exception

exception is runtime error ,and when exception is generated then program execution is stopped,
we don't want to stop the program execution then we need to handle exception
when we handle the exception ,program execution is continued even after the exception

exception is handle by using try catch block
1.try-monitor an exception
2.catch-handle the exception which is thrown by try block

Exception is base class for all child exception
Exception class can handle all types of exception.

finally:finally is always executed even after the exception is present or not

class Exception
{
	string msg;

	public Exception(string m)
	{
		msg=m;
	}

	public string Message
	{
		get
		{
			return msg;
		}
	}
}
