1)method which doesnot have body declare that method as abstract.
2)class which contains abstract methods declare that class as abstract
3)when we inherit abstract class, we must override all abstract methods from the abstract class into derived class.
4)cannot create instance/object of abstract class


abstract method-must be override
virtual method-should be override

class car{}

class thar:car{}

class-->class(inherits)
interface-->class(implements)

1.interface methods are by default abstract(method does not have body)
2)when we implement interface then all abstract methods from the interface must be override into derived class.
3)cannot create object of interface

difference between abstract class and interface
multiple inheritance is not supported in csharp
you can inherit only one class

abstract class-can inherit only one class
interface-can implements multiple interfaces.

class-->class          --inheritance
interface-->class      --implements
interface-->interface  --inheritance
