object should initialize immediately after the creation of object.
constructor is called immediately after the creation of object,so we can initlize the object in the constructor

syntax:
1.constructor name is similar as class name
2.constructor does not have any return type not even void


types of constructor
1.default constructor-if user not given any constructor then compiler provide default constructor.
it does not have any parameter.

2.parameterized constructor
